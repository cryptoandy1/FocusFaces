              I&apos;ve been involved in programming since 2016. I&apos;m
              self-taught in this field. Coding for me is one of the two
              activities I can engage myself in all day long (second one is
              playing guitar ðŸŽ¸ðŸ˜„)
            </p>

              I started off by learning Python and I have basic skills in it.
              But at the moment, my primary focus is on building responsive and
              interactive web-applications using React.js. Currently, I&apos;m
              studying Next.js as a recommended framework for modern React
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              For several years I&apos;ve been engaged in crypto sphere and have
              been involved in testing emerging projects there. So I have quite
              an interest in building something for web3 one day. Hence,
              Solidity is definately in my &apos;To do&apos; list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, lately I&apos;ve become a big fan of Three.js library that
              simplifies workflow with WebGL API and let us build absolutely
              beautiful things (some of which you can find in my
              &apos;portfolio&apos; section and on this page as well ðŸ˜‰ )
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy working in team and the process of sharing experience and
              ideas beetween people, but I&apos;m ok working by myself as well.
              Also, I&apos;m a self-disciplined person who respects deadlines
              and I like to see those qualities in people.
