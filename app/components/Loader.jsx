          I&apos;ve been involved in programming since 2016. I&apos;m
          self-taught in this field. Coding for me is one of the two activities
          I can engage myself in all day long (second one is playing guitar
          ðŸŽ¸ðŸ˜„)
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off by learning Python and I have basic skills in it. But at
          the moment, my primary focus is on building responsive and interactive
          web-applications using React.js. Currently, I&apos;m practicing with
          Next.js as a recommended framework for modern React development.
        </p>
        <p>
          For several years I&apos;ve been engaged in crypto sphere and have
          been involved in testing emerging crypto-projects. So I have quite an
          interest in building something for web3. And therefore, I&apos;m
          interested in Solidity development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, lately I&apos;ve become a big fan of Three.js library that
          simplifies workflow with WebGL API and let us build absolutely
          beautiful things (some of which you can find in the
          &apos;Portfolio&apos; section below and on this page as well ðŸ˜‰ )
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working in team and the process of sharing experience and
          ideas beetween people, but I&apos;m ok with working by myself as well.
          Also, I&apos;m a self-disciplined person who respects deadlines and I
          like to see those qualities in people.
